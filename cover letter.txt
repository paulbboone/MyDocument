My passion for exploring new business opportunities, building client relationships, and developing market strategies aligns perfectly with this role.

During my internship at CJ OLIVENETWORKS VINA, I had the opportunity to:
Analyze and optimize business processes, identifying improvements that enhanced operational efficiency.
Design contract management screen interfaces to improve user experience.
Develop test cases and perform software testing in Jira, ensuring product quality before deployment.
Additionally, my experience in customer service and sales-related roles has strengthened my ability to understand client needs and build successful business relationships. With strong English communication skills (TOEIC Listening and Reading: 835), analytical thinking, and a proactive mindset, I am confident in my ability to drive growth and contribute effectively to HITEK SOFTWARE.

I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration in reviewing my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with the needs of your team. I look forward to your response and the possibility of contributing to HITEK SOFTWARE.
