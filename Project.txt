One noteworthy initiative in which I used data analysis and market research to inform business decisions was when I was involved in developing a forecasting model for gold prices using machine learning.
I analysed trends and important financial indicators as part of a market research project on machine learning-based gold price forecasts. The research involved gathering and analysing past price data, applying models like Prophet and XGBoost, and combining technical indicators like Price Rate of Change and Parabolic SAR. I supported strategic investment decisions by offering insights into gold price fluctuations through the evaluation of model performance. The study showed the value of sophisticated forecasting methods in financial markets and emphasised the influence of economic factors on price swings.
